      "In the year 2020, the challenge set by Hult Prize was to come up with a business idea such that with every sale made, we have a net positive impact on the environment and acquire 1 million customers within 10 years. \n For this, our team proposed a technique to make degradable packaged water bottles made of Baggase. Baggase is an alternative of sugarcane industry. The proposed bottles were 20% cheaper to manufacture than conventional bottles. \n\nAlong with this, we studied the packaged water bottle industry to understand the entire supply chain. We made talks with several event management companies and came to know that hundreds of thousands of bottles are sold in a week in such events. With this insight, we came up with a go-to market strategy and the financial model for our product. ";

The problem posed was that 80% of the users (sellers) are leaving the application within the first 15 days. \n\nOur team mined the playstore reviews and analyzed them to come up with insights about the problems faced by the users. After identifying the problems faced by the user, we came up with three new features to solve this issue: Store rewards, inventory management, and customer offers and rewards. We also identified the success metrics & negatively impacted metrics and won the second position. \n\nYou can check out the link to have a look at the submission by our team.";

  static const String product20 =
      "This is an annually held competition under the Technology General Championship of IIT Kharagpur. This year, we identified the problem of non-use of helmets by bike riders. Every year more than 40,000 because of two-wheeler accidents and majority of them die because of not wearing helments. \n\nTo solve this, we conceptualized a smart helmet that makes it compulsory for the rider to wear it in order to ride the bike. We developed a clutch control module which disengages the clutch if the rider is not wearing the helmet. Apart from this, we integrated other features like accident detection and a module to detect alcohol levels of the rider using a sensor (breathalyzer). In case the rider is in influence of alcohol above a certain threshold, once again, the clutch control module will take over and will disengage the clutch. \n\nWith this idea, our team stood first among 17 participating teams in the Open IIT tournament at IIT kharagpur.

      "For this competition, our team identified the problem of accidental gas leaks in household LPG cylinders causing deadly accidents. \n\nTo solve this, we deviced a low-cost anti-gas leak regulator which is designed to directly cut-off the gas supply from the cylinder reducing the chances of hazardous accidents. For this, we used three MQ6 gas sensors to detect gas leaks and added a linear actuator in the regulator to cut off the gas supply. \n\nwith this product, our team stood as the third runner up among 22 participant teams.";
